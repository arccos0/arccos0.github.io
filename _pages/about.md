I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematics and Industrial Engineering at Polytechnique Montréal, advised by Michel Gendreau and André Langevin. My interest lies in vehicle routing problems, packing problems as well as the combination of machine learning and integer programming. Before joining Polytechnique, I graduated from Beijing University of Post and Telecommunication with a B.S. in Mechanical and Automation Engineering on June 2014 and from Shanghai Jiao Tong University with a M.S. in Industrial Engineering on Mar 2018. From Jan 2018 to July 2018, I worked as an operations research analyst in Youhualin Information Technology（Shanghai）Co. Ltd.
