All the instances involved in the project can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YPWRLesVrDa0lpn5zZg1mRWXzPus8bWH/view?usp=sharing) including the instances to generate training data, validation data as well as the existing instances from the literature.
The feasibility predictor can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j3lLncUSu8UlRpSkHt7UUlNkJEaJJG_-/view?usp=sharing). The file is in .pt format. To load the , one could visit the [page](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html). You could test the predictor on these [test files](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vj2vlKO7LWYv2tkY65K4oWdHIVhO6HJP/view?usp=sharing), which should be consistent to what is reported in the paper.
